  "Phase machine: the states a forestry-support-service order transits
  through.

  State machine:
    :intake -> :survey -> :advise -> :treat -> :record -> :audit

  `:intake` is service-request receiving (client forest operator, stand,
  requested service); `:survey` is stand/forest-condition assessment;
  `:advise` is the advisor's scheduling recommendation; `:treat` is the
  actual timber-cruising/seed-collection/fire-protection-support/
  log-transport field work performed for the client forest operator;
  `:record` is logging the completed service (evidence, safety
  parameters) into records; `:audit` is compliance audit, the terminal
  state. This sequence matches the registry's own registered
  `:operating-states` for ISIC 0240 exactly.

  Each transition can accept a proposal and yield an audit fact.")
