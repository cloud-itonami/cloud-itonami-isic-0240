  Example flow:
    1. Start with empty store
    2. Register a service order in :intake phase
    3. Propose a service order -> :record transition with safety
       parameters (operator certification / equipment inspection / wind
       speed / riparian buffer / haul-road load)
    4. Governor validates parameters against facts
    5. If valid, audit fact is committed
    6. CLI prints audit trail")
